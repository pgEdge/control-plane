# Installing Control Plane

The Control Plane simplifies deployment of high-availability Postgres clusters in an easy-to-manage environment, running on bare metal, in VMs, or in the cloud.

In the documentation, you'll find instructions for deploying Control Plane in two configurations:

* The Quickstart guide deploys a three node distributed Postgres database on a single (local) host, creating a perfect environment for experimenting with Control Plane.

* On the Installation page you'll find instructions for deploying a Control Plane server to each node of your custom cluster.
