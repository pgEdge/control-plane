# Installing Control Plane

The Control Plane simplifies deployment of high-availability Postgres clusters in an easy-to-manage environment, running on bare metal, in VMs, or in the cloud.

In the documentation, you'll find instructions for deploying Control Plane in two configurations:

* The [Quickstart guide](quickstart.md) deploys a three node distributed Postgres database on your local host, creating a perfect environment for experimenting with Control Plane.

* Visit [Installing the Control Plane](installation.md) for detailed instructions for deploying a Control Plane server to your custom hosts.
