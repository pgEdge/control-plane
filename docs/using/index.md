# Using Control Plane API Calls

Control Plane API calls simplify deployment, automation, scalability, and command repeatability. The API provides a structured, reliable way to perform predictable patterns using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE, and return results in a standardized format.

The Control Plane server serves a JSON OpenAPI v3 specification from the /v1/openapi.json endpoint. It also implements [RFC 8631](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8631) for use with tools like [Restish](https://rest.sh/#/).
